    WARNING:

    Override NSLOG() for iOS >= 10.x due to major change by Apple in iOS 10 SDK.
    Currently apps built with Xcode 7.x, iOS 9.x SDK don't produce any logs with NSLog()
    when deplyed on devices running on >= iOS v10.x.
    This implementation should be erased once AppBuilder starts using
    Xcode 8.x with iOS 10.x SDK for the build procedure.

    In iOS 10 & Xcode 8, Apple switched from the good old ASL (Apple System Log)
    to a new logging system called Unified Logging.
    NSLog calls are in fact delegating to new os_log API's.
    See for more details https://developer.apple.com/reference/os/1891852-logging

    From: https://developer.apple.com/reference/os/os_log_with_type?language=objc
        Calling this function doesnâ€™t ensure that a message is logged.
        Logging always occurs in accordance with the behavior settings
        of the provided log object and type. Note that lengthy log
        messages may be truncated when stored by the logging system.
 
    From <os/log.h>, line 221, https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-3789.1.32/libkern/os/log.h?txt:
        * There is a physical cap of 1024 bytes per log line for dynamic content,
        * such as %s and %@, that can be written to the persistence store.
        * All content exceeding the limit will be truncated before it is
        * written to disk.
